## 🚀 Quick Start

Get your bot up and running in minutes with these two simple steps.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Create your own copy of Dex Mini Bot by forking on GitHub.

### 2. Obtain Your Session String

Use the pair code generator to get a session string. Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp **Linked Devices** and copy the resulting string.

sessionID: 'DEXMINIBOT~H4.....'
```

Or set it as the environment variable SESSION_ID on your hosting platform.
